µLauncher is a home screen that lets you start other apps using swipe gestures and button presses.
It is <b>minimal, efficient and free of distraction</b>.

Your homescreen only displays the date, time and a wallpaper.
Pressing back or swiping up (this can be configures) opens a list
of all installed apps, which can be searched efficiently.


This is a fork of the app <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.finnmglas.launcher/">Launcher</a>
by Finn M Glas.

Notable changes:
* Edge gestures: There is a setting to allow distinguishing swiping at the edges of the screen from swiping in the center.
* Compatible with work profile, so apps like Shelter can be used.
* This app uses the system wallpaper instead of a custom solution.
* The font has been changed to Hack.
* Font Awesome Icons were replaced by Material icons.
* The gear button on the home screen was removed. Instead pressing back opens the list of applications and the app settings are accessible from there.
* The search algorithm was modified to prefer matches at the beginning of the app name, i.e. when searching for "te", "termux" is sorted before "notes".
* The search bar was moved to the bottom of the screen
